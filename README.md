# Hangman-Game
Hangman game - Assignment 3


This is a little game made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  There is a small embed to play a song in a small window with Spotify.   

Instructions: (pretty much on the page)

- Press Start to play
- Hit keys on the keyboard to guess the letters
- 10 Guesses are the limit.
- Score is tallied depending on win or loss.  
- Incorrect keys are displayed on screen
- The subject of the words are all musicians.

Things to improve: 

- This is written using Bootstrap.  Change using CSS grid.
- This does not work on an Ipad since they keyboard cannot be toggled on. ( maybe add the letters as clickable buttons that disappear.
